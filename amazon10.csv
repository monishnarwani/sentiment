Then needed a new battery as well. $100 later (not including cost of purchase) I have a usable phone. The phone should not have been sold in the state it was in.,0

"""CLEAR CLEAN ESN"" Sprint EPIC 4G Galaxy SPH-D700*FRONT CAMERA*ANDROID*SLIDER*QWERTY KEYBOARD*TOUCH SCREEN",Samsung,199.99,5,"I originally was using the Samsung S2 Galaxy for Sprint and wanted to return back to the Samsung EPIC 4G for Sprint because I really missed the keyboard, I really liked the smaller compact size of the phone, and I still needed some of the basic functions of a smart phone (i.e. checking e-mail, getting directions, text messaging) Because the phone is not as powerful as the newer cell phones out there, just be aware that the more applications you install the slower the phone runs and will most likely freeze up from time to time. But the camera works great, the video is great as well, and even the web browsing is decent and gives me what I need. I also notice that battery life lasts a little bit longer and charging the phone is much quicker than my Galaxy S2.",0

The only issue is that sometimes the screen goes black and you have to press the top button several times to get the screen to re-illuminate.,0
